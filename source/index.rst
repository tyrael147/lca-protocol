A protocol prototype to enhance replicability and reproducibility in Life Cycle Oriented studies
======================================================================================

This site presents a first prototype of an LCA-oriented protocol that consists on guidelines and checkpoints for LCA practitioners that can facilitate the generation of reproducible research outputs. 
The main :ref:`protocol <protocol>` draft was built following current practices used in other research fields in combination with the needs of programmatic LCA.
While this draft has a `LIST <https://www.list.lu/>`_ flavor, we expect it to be adapted to the requirements of a broader group of practitioners.
