A protocol prototype to enhance replicability and reproducibility in Life Cycle Oriented studies
======================================================================================

This site presents a first prototype of an LCA-oriented protocol that consists on guidelines and checkpoints for LCA practitioners that can facilitate the generation of reproducible research outputs. 
The main :ref:`protocol <protocol>` draft was built following current practices used in other research fields in combination with the needs of programmatic LCA.
While this draft has a `LIST <https://www.list.lu/>`_ flavor, we expect it to be adapted to the requirements of a broader group of practitioners.

===========

While still in diapers, we are developing a `templating tool <https://git.list.lu/gustavo.larrea/replicable-lca>`_ to automate the setup of \
Life Cycle Oriented projects compliant with the protocol. 

It can be installed like this:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install git+ssh@git.list.lu:gustavo.larrea/replicable-lca.git

bw2scaffold is an open-source project, contributions are welcomed.
