Notebooks and interactive visualization
---------------------------------------

.. note::
    Notebooks are designed for experimenting rather than reusing pieces of code. 
    Unfortunately, code inside a notebook do not facilitate modularisation, and they \
    can even failing in execution unless the cells are run in the exact same\ 
    order ran by the author [1]_



.. [1] The limitations with the use of notebooks for reporting scientific code are also are stated in other `scientific`_ fields (e.g., `data science`_)
