Project description
===================

Any Life Cycle Oriented study must be accompanied by a report of the project's characteristics.
For this, the following guidelines can be used by the ``PRACTITIONER`` to generate \
a `reproducible` report. 
The protocol does not prefer a particular format for reporting (e.g., .docx, .tex, .md, .rst, etc.) as long as the following four subsections are considered.

Purpose
-------

The arguments of :footcite:t:`grimm2020odd` can be adapted to say that every `Life \
Cycle study has to start from a clear question, problem, or hypothesis; \
readers cannot understand the study unless they understand its purpose`.
In this sense, the ``PRACTITIONER`` should provide a clear statement of the reason why \
the different models and pipelines in this project were developed.

.. note::
    
    The purpose description goes beyond the LCA `Goal and Scope` step found in ISO14040 \
    because the LCA could be just one stage of a high-level Life Cycle Oriented study.
    For instance, some studies may use the LCA stage to calculation impact factors that \
    will be later fed into an Material Flow Analysis (MFA) model. In this case, the high-level \
    purpose is more related to the MFA stage than to the LCA.


Based on the recommendations of :footcite:t:`grimm2020odd`, the purpose has these \
characteristics:

    * It is precise and specific, avoiding vague terms like "explore" or "study".
    * It describes the current study avoiding to include future studies or follow-ups.
    * It does NOT describe the models since they will be described in following sections.
    * It is COMPLETELY independent and self contained since it does not require to be \
      linked to any document or section of the protocol to be fully understood.


Inputs metadata 
----------------

TODO: This section mentiones the recomended metadata properties that data files should \
include. Considering relying on README files for this.


Life Cycle Inventory model overview
-----------------------------------

TODO: This section gives guidelines to describe the multiple LCI models in terms of LCI construction model and supply network characteristics.


Submodels overview
------------------

TODO: This section gives guidelines to describe the different NON-Life Cycle models that will provide inputs or consume outputs during the computational pipeline.
